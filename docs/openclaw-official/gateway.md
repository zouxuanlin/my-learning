## Runtime model

- One always-on process for routing, control plane, and channel connections.

- Single multiplexed port for:

WebSocket control/RPC

- HTTP APIs (OpenAI-compatible, Responses, tools invoke)

- Control UI and hooks

- Default bind mode: loopback.

- Auth is required by default (gateway.auth.token / gateway.auth.password, or OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN / OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD).

### Port and bind precedence

SettingResolution order
Gateway port--port → OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT → gateway.port → 18789
Bind modeCLI/override → gateway.bind → loopback

### Hot reload modes

gateway.reload.modeBehavior
offNo config reload
hotApply only hot-safe changes
restartRestart on reload-required changes
hybrid (default)Hot-apply when safe, restart when required

## Operator command set

openclaw gateway status
openclaw gateway status --deep
openclaw gateway status --json
openclaw gateway install
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw gateway stop
openclaw secrets reload
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw doctor

## Remote access

Preferred: Tailscale/VPN.
Fallback: SSH tunnel.
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 user@host

Then connect clients to ws://127.0.0.1:18789 locally.

See: [Remote Gateway](/gateway/remote), [Authentication](/gateway/authentication), [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale).

## Supervision and service lifecycle

Use supervised runs for production-like reliability.

- macOS (launchd)
- Linux (systemd user)
- Linux (system service)
openclaw gateway install
openclaw gateway status
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw gateway stop

LaunchAgent labels are ai.openclaw.gateway (default) or ai.openclaw.<profile> (named profile). openclaw doctor audits and repairs service config drift.

openclaw gateway install
systemctl --user enable --now openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service
openclaw gateway status

For persistence after logout, enable lingering:
sudo loginctl enable-linger <user>

Use a system unit for multi-user/always-on hosts.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service

## Multiple gateways on one host

Most setups should run one Gateway.
Use multiple only for strict isolation/redundancy (for example a rescue profile).
Checklist per instance:

- Unique gateway.port

- Unique OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH

- Unique OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR

- Unique agents.defaults.workspace

Example:
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.openclaw/a.json OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.openclaw-a openclaw gateway --port 19001
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.openclaw/b.json OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.openclaw-b openclaw gateway --port 19002

See: [Multiple gateways](/gateway/multiple-gateways).

### Dev profile quick path

openclaw --dev setup
openclaw --dev gateway --allow-unconfigured
openclaw --dev status

Defaults include isolated state/config and base gateway port 19001.

## Protocol quick reference (operator view)

- First client frame must be connect.

- Gateway returns hello-ok snapshot (presence, health, stateVersion, uptimeMs, limits/policy).

- Requests: req(method, params) → res(ok/payload|error).

- Common events: connect.challenge, agent, chat, presence, tick, health, heartbeat, shutdown.

Agent runs are two-stage:

- Immediate accepted ack (status:"accepted")

- Final completion response (status:"ok"|"error"), with streamed agent events in between.

See full protocol docs: [Gateway Protocol](/gateway/protocol).

## Operational checks

### Liveness

- Open WS and send connect.

- Expect hello-ok response with snapshot.

### Readiness

openclaw gateway status
openclaw channels status --probe
openclaw health

### Gap recovery

Events are not replayed. On sequence gaps, refresh state (health, system-presence) before continuing.

## Common failure signatures

SignatureLikely issue
refusing to bind gateway ... without authNon-loopback bind without token/password
another gateway instance is already listening / EADDRINUSEPort conflict
Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=localConfig set to remote mode
unauthorized during connectAuth mismatch between client and gateway

For full diagnosis ladders, use [Gateway Troubleshooting](/gateway/troubleshooting).

## Safety guarantees

- Gateway protocol clients fail fast when Gateway is unavailable (no implicit direct-channel fallback).

- Invalid/non-connect first frames are rejected and closed.

- Graceful shutdown emits shutdown event before socket close.
