“EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE!” — A space lobster, probably

Any OS gateway for AI agents across WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more.

Send a message, get an agent response from your pocket. Plugins add Mattermost and more.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is a self-hosted gateway that connects your favorite chat apps — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more — to AI coding agents like Pi. You run a single Gateway process on your own machine (or a server), and it becomes the bridge between your messaging apps and an always-available AI assistant.
Who is it for? Developers and power users who want a personal AI assistant they can message from anywhere — without giving up control of their data or relying on a hosted service.
What makes it different?

- Self-hosted: runs on your hardware, your rules

- Multi-channel: one Gateway serves WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and more simultaneously

- Agent-native: built for coding agents with tool use, sessions, memory, and multi-agent routing

- Open source: MIT licensed, community-driven

What do you need? Node 22+, an API key from your chosen provider, and 5 minutes. For best quality and security, use the strongest latest-generation model available.

## How it works

The Gateway is the single source of truth for sessions, routing, and channel connections.

## Dashboard

Open the browser Control UI after the Gateway starts.

- Local default: [http://127.0.0.1:18789/](http://127.0.0.1:18789/)

- Remote access: [Web surfaces](/web) and [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale)

## Configuration (optional)

Config lives at ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.

- If you do nothing, OpenClaw uses the bundled Pi binary in RPC mode with per-sender sessions.

- If you want to lock it down, start with channels.whatsapp.allowFrom and (for groups) mention rules.

Example:
{
 channels: {
 whatsapp: {
 allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
 groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
 },
 },
 messages: { groupChat: { mentionPatterns: ["@openclaw"] } },
}
